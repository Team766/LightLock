Top Level Design Reasoning
    For explaining why architecure, hardware, and methodology decisions were made, and to audit those decisions

Section 01:
    Methodology
        Possible Localization Solutions
            Inertial
                MEMS vs. Non-MEMS sensors
                    MEMS
                        Prone to Drift due to noise and double-integration
                        Low Power
                        Cheap
                        Catastrophic drift over short time
                    Non-MEMS
                        Expensive
                        Heavy
                        Power-Intensive
                        Accurate Enough
            Signals
                GPS
                    Cannot Penetrate Buildings, no readout
                WIFI
                    Requires expensive and intensive design, build test
                    Expensive components
                    May be inaccurate, to ~1 meter
                    Difficult to Design
                Other
                    Not allowed under current usual ruleset
            Lighting
                Relatively Cheap
                    See This Document, "Section 2"
                Thorough knowledge base
                    Computer Vision is very well studied
                Authorities available
                    Via Zoox
                Probably accurate to required levels
                Probably fast
                    If not, changing processor hardware can fix this
                Maintainable
                    Other people could work on this after CB leaves

Section 02:
    Hardware
        Camera
            Fisheye vs. Flat
                Fisheye:
                    Can see entire possible area of interest
                    Requires more complex vision operations
                    More Expensive
                    Calibration may be a necessity for the lens
                Flat:
                    Cannot see entire area of interest >> Fatal
        Processor
            Single Board Computer
                Cheap
                Available
                Abundant IO Solutions
                Well-Documented
                Linux-Based
                Low but non-negligable power use
                Expense and KISS violation
            Main Processor
                Slow
                Possible Hangs in critical robot code >> Fatal
        Mounting
            High:
            Low on superstructure:
                High Probability obstructions >> Fatal
        Gyroscope
            Without an accurate gyroscope, orientation deterimination will be infeasible
        Acceleromiter Input
            For Kalman Filter, non-necessary but high-level force multiplier
