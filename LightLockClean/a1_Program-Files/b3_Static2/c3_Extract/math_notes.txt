So, math_code works like this.

Each light has an absolute position. (0,0) is in the center of the field, with
a standard cartesian position system from there. Angles are from 0 to 360, 
starting on the x-axis and going clockwise.

To test the code, pick a position for the robot. Figure out the angles to any
two lights, relative to the robot heading (so if the robot is at 0,0 light is at 1,1
robot heading = 315 then the light at -1,1 is at 90). This is all done according
to the camera view, but you might have to do some trig to test arbitrary points.

I know these work, but play around. It isn't final, but it shows that the math works,
if you can ID the lights. Discord me for help, and someone delete this when you 
are done, I need to improve it for use in the main loop.
